Examples
========

Here you can find a series of example scripts you can run to test your ``pyc2ray`` installation. The scripts can be find on GitHub, `here`_.

These scripts include standard radiative transfer (RT) test simulations that were used in the original paper, `Mellema et al. (2006) <https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0508416>`_, and in the recent update, `Hirling et al. (2023) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01492>`_.

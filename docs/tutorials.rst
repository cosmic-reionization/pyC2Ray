Tutorials
=========

Here you can find tutorials that will help you get started with ``pyc2ray``.

These scripts will help you familiarize yourself with the memory usage and speed-up of the new ray-tracing code, so you can optimize your runs.  
They also provide explanations of the source and sink models implemented in ``pyc2ray``, an example script to define your own sources and sinks, and a first example showing how to set up a cosmological simulation.

This section is under active development, and some example scripts are still in progress. Do not hesitate to open an `issue`_ if you find any bugs, errors or missing explanations.
